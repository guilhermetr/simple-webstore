# Simple Angular Webstore

This project is a straightforward webstore built using Angular framework. The webstore features a responsive user-friendly interface where products are displayed on the home page, fetched dynamically from a 'products.json' file. Users can add products to their cart from the home page and view the cart via a popup or dedicated cart page, where they can also edit quantities and remove items as needed.

## Running the app

### Using npm and Angular CLI

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Go to the project directory.
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
